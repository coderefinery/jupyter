Introduction to Jupyter and JupyterLab
======================================

The goal of this lesson is to teach learners the user interface of JupyterLab,
how Jupyter notebooks work, and what some common and powerful usecases are.

For many learners, notebooks are not a new concept,
and our goal will be to demonstrate and discuss and guide towards good practices
for **reproducibility, collaboration, and reusability**.


.. prereq::

  - A reasonably recent version of Jupyter and JupyterLab, which is installed
    as part of the
    `Conda environment for CodeRefinery workshops <https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/conda-environment/>`__.
  - Optional (we only demonstrate this):
    A reasonably recent version of Git to be able to work with the JupyterLab Git integration.
