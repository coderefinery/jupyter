# JupyterLab and notebook interface

```{objectives}
- Learn to navigate JupyterLab user interface.
- Discuss integrated development environments.
- Get an overview of useful keyboard shortcuts.
- Learn about command/edit modes and markdown/code cells.
```

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Jupyter notebooks
and is intended to replace the conventional interface.
It is a highly modular and customizable interface.

## How to start JupyterLab

Let's have a look at how it works. We go to terminal, and type:
```console
$ mkdir jupyterlab-demo
$ cd jupyterlab-demo
$ jupyter-lab
```

## Navigation

- Left-hand menu (toggle it with `Ctrl(⌘)-b`):
     - File browser
         - New launcher
         - New folder
         - Upload files
     - Running terminals and kernels
     - Command palette
     - Cell inspector
     - Open tabs
     - Git integration (if `jupyterlab-git` extension installed)
     - GitHub browser (if `jupyterlab-github` extension installed)
- Fully-fledged terminal
- Text editor for source code in different languages
- Code console to run code interactively in a kernel with rich output and linear order
- Modular interface
     - Notebooks, terminals, consoles, data files etc can be moved around
- Classical notebook style is available under the Help menu

## Cells

- **Markdown cells** contain formatted text written in Markdown
- **Code cells** contain code to be interpreted by the *kernel* (Python, R, Julia, Octave/Matlab...)


### Markdown cells

```markdown
## Second level heading

This cell contains simple
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), a simple language for writing text that can be automatically converted to other formats, e.g. HTML, LaTeX or any of a number of others.

**Bold**, *italics*, **_combined_**, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`.

* bullet points

or

1. numbered
3. lists

**Equations:**
inline $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
or on new line
$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

```


### Code cells

```python
# a code cell can run statements of code.
# when you run this cell, the output is sent
# from the web page to a back-end process, run
# and the results are displayed to you
print("hello world")
```


### Command and edit modes

- To add contents to a cell, you need to enter *edit mode* by pressing `Enter` or
  double-clicking on a cell
- To navigate between cells, create new cells, etc., you need to enter *command* mode by
  pressing `Escape` key or executing the current cell.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Some shortcuts only work in Command or Edit mode. 
It can also happen that these shortcuts interfere with browser shortcuts.


### Cell shortcuts

| Shortcut | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| `Enter` | Enter Edit mode |
|`Escape` or `Ctrl`-`m` | Enter Command mode |
| `Ctrl`-`Enter` | Run the cell |
| `Shift`-`Enter`| Run the cell and select the cell below |
| `Alt`-`Enter`| Run the cell and insert a new cell below |
| `m` and `y` | Toggle between Markdown and Code cells |
| `d-d` | Delete a cell |
| `z` | Undo deleting  |
| `a/b` | Insert cells above/below current cell |
| `x/c/v` | Cut/copy/paste cells |
| `Up/Down` or `k/j` | Select previous/next cells |


### Notebook shortcuts

| Shortcut | Effect |
| -------- | ------ |
| `Ctrl(⌘)`-`s` | Save notebook |
| `Shift`-`Ctrl(⌘)`-`s` | Save notebook as |
| `Ctrl`-q | Close notebook |
| `Ctrl(⌘)`-`b` | Toggle left-hand menu |
| `Shift`-`Ctrl(⌘)`-`c` | Open command palette |
| `Shift`-`Ctrl(⌘)`-d | Toggle single-document mode |

```{discussion} Integrated development environments
- What tools do you use for writing, testing, and debugging code?

Some people prefer **terminal-based text editors** for writing code (e.g. Vi/Vim, Nano, Emacs, etc.).

Others prefer **integrated development environments (IDEs)**,
which can bring "everything" one needs for productive programming to one's fingertips.a

Yet others prefer **code editors**, which are light-weight IDEs.

**Terminal editor**
- Good command line skills are needed for effectively using terminal editors
- Continue using Emacs and Vim, if you are already proficient
- Supports multiple programming languages

**Code editor**
- If you use multiple programming languages then code editors offer good support
- Both IDE and code editors share common features such as code completion, hints, highlighting sections of code
- Supports multiple programming languages

**IDE**
- If you are working with large code bases, then you should definitely checkout the IDE suitable for your programming language
- IDEs offer rich support for Debugging and Code refactoring
- Focused on a single language
```
