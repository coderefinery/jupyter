# Jupyter Notebooks

```{questions}
- What are Jupyter Notebooks?
- What can Jupyter Notebooks be used for?
```

```{objectives}
- Get an idea of the purpose of Jupyter.
- See some inspirational Jupyter notebooks.
```


## Some history
- In 2014, Fernando PÃ©rez announced a spin-off project from IPython called Project Jupyter, moving the notebook and other language-agnostic parts of IPython to Jupyter.
- The name "Jupyter" derives from Julia+Python+R, but today Jupyter kernels exist for [dozens of programming languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).
- Galileo's publication in a pamphlet in 1610 in Sidereus Nuncius, one of the first notebooks!

## What are Jupyter notebooks?

- A [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) tool.
- Code, text, equations, figures, etc. are interleaved, creating a *computational narrative*.
- [*"an environment in which users execute code, see what happens, modify and repeat in a kind of iterative conversation between researcher and data"*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07196-1)

## Case examples

### [Gravitational wave discovery](https://www.gw-openscience.org/about/)

```

Let us have a look at the analysis published together with the
discovery of gravitational waves. [This
page](https://losc.ligo.org/tutorials/) lists the available analyses
and presents several options to browse them.

- A quick look at short segments of data can be found at
  [https://github.com/losc-tutorial/quickview](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/quickview)
- The notebook can be opened and interactively explored
  using Binder by clicking the "launch Binder" button.
- How does the Binder instance know which Python packages to load?


### [Activity inequality](http://activityinequality.stanford.edu/) study

```

Researchers in the Stanford Activity Inequality Study measured daily
activity from cell phone tracking data for over 700,000 users in
different countries across the world.
- All data and notebooks are available at
  [https://github.com/timalthoff/activityinequality](https://github.com/timalthoff/activityinequality)
- Even without a "launch binder" button, the notebooks can still be
  [launched on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/timalthoff/activityinequality/master)
  (you may see an error "missing R kernel" because a file `runtime.txt` is missing - more about that later)
- Do you see any potential problems in recreating e.g.
  [fig3bc](https://github.com/timalthoff/activityinequality/blob/master/fig3/fig3bc.ipynb)?

## Common use cases

- Really good for **linear workflows** (e.g. read data, filter data, do some statistics, plot the results)
- Experimenting with new ideas, testing new libraries/databases
- As an *interactive* development environment for code, data analysis and visualization
- Interactive work on HPC clusters
- Sharing and explaining code to colleagues
- Teaching (programming, experimental/theoretical science)
- Learning from other notebooks
- Keeping track of interactive sessions, like a digital lab notebook
- Supplementary information with published articles
- Slide presentations using [Reveal.js](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE)


### Pitfalls with notebooks

- Less useful for **large codebases**.
  They **don't promote modularity**, and once you get started in a
  notebook it can be hard to migrate to modules.
  Once lots of code is in notebooks, it can be **hard to change to
  proper programs that can be scripted**.
- Less useful for **non-linear code flow**.
- They are **difficult to test**. There are things to run notebooks as
  unit tests like [nbval](https://nbval.readthedocs.io/), but it's not
  perfect.
- Notebooks can be **version controlled**
  ([nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/) helps with that), but
  there are **still limitations**.
- You can **change code after you run it** and run code out of order.
  This can make debugging hard and results irreproducible if you
  aren't careful. We recommend to **run all cells before sharing notebooks with others**.
- Notebooks **aren't named by default** and tend to **acquire a bunch of
  unrelated stuff**.  Be careful with organization!
- See also <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/jupyter-pitfalls.html>
- You cannot easily write a notebook directly in your text editor (but you can do
  that with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)).

```{keypoints}
- Jupyter is an open-source, interactive web tool allowing researchers
  to combine code, output, explanatory text and multimedia resources
  in a single document.
